## Introduction
`eth-data-library` is a Node.js library designed for interacting with Ethereum blockchain data. It provides functions to connect to an Ethereum node, retrieve account balances, fetch transactions, and process blockchain data efficiently.

## Installation
Install `eth-data-library` using npm:

```bash
npm install eth-data-library
```

Or using yarn:

```bash
yarn add eth-data-library
```

## Usage
### Connecting to Ethereum Node
To connect to an Ethereum node:

```javascript
const { connectToEthereumNode } = require('eth-data-library');
const nodeUrl = 'http://127.0.0.1:7545'; // Replace with your Ethereum node URL

async function main() {
  try {
    await connectToEthereumNode(nodeUrl);
    console.log('Connected to Ethereum node successfully!');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to connect to Ethereum node:', error);
  }
}

main();
```

### Querying Data
#### getBalance(address)
Retrieve the balance of an Ethereum address:

```javascript
const { getBalance } = require('eth-data-library');

async function main() {
  const address = '0x1234567890AbCdEf1234567890AbCdEf12345678';
  try {
    const balance = await getBalance(address);
    console.log(`Balance of ${address}: ${balance} wei`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error retrieving balance:', error);
  }
}

main();
```

#### getTransactions(address, fromBlock, toBlock)
Fetch transactions for an address within a block range:

```javascript
const { getTransactions } = require('eth-data-library');

async function main() {
  const address = '0x1234567890AbCdEf1234567890AbCdEf12345678';
  const fromBlock = 0;
  const toBlock = 'latest';
  try {
    const transactions = await getTransactions(address, fromBlock, toBlock);
    console.log(`Transactions for ${address}:`, transactions);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching transactions:', error);
  }
}

main();
```

### Processing Results
You can process and manipulate the retrieved data as per your requirements using JavaScript functions and libraries.

## API Reference
### getBalance(address)
- **Parameters:**
  - `address` (string): Ethereum address for which to retrieve the balance.
- **Returns:**
  - `Promise<string>`: Promise that resolves to the balance in wei as a string.

### getTransactions(address, fromBlock, toBlock)
- **Parameters:**
  - `address` (string): Ethereum address for which to fetch transactions.
  - `fromBlock` (number): Starting block number (inclusive).
  - `toBlock` (number or string): Ending block number (inclusive) or `'latest'`.
- **Returns:**
  - `Promise<Object[]>`: Promise that resolves to an array of transactions.
